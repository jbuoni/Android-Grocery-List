# Design Document

*This is the template for your design document. The parts in italics are concise explanations of what should go in the corresponding sections and should not appear in the final document.*

## 1 Design Considerations

### 1.1 Assumptions

1. The application will be run only on Android smartphones.
	- The Android smartphones will have at least an API 19 our higher
2. The application will support only one user, and does not need to be distributed. 
3. Users of the application will understand the English language.


### 1.2 Constraints

1. Application has to run on Android.
2. Application has to be able to save user related data in some sort of way.
3. Applicaiton has to support API level 19, at a minimum.


### 1.3 System Environment
The application will run on Android smartphones that have at least an API level of 19 (Kit Kat). Android smartphones that have higher API levels can also be used to run
the application. The application will store data in an SQLite database packaged with the application.

## 2 Architectural Design

*The architecture provides the high-level design view of a system and provides a basis for more detailed design work. These subsections describe the top-level components of the system you are building and their relationships.*

### 2.1 Component Diagram

TODO Daniel

*This section should provide and describe a diagram that shows the various components and how they are connected. This diagram shows the logical/functional components of the system, where each component represents a cluster of related functionality. In the case of simple systems, where there is a single component, this diagram may be unnecessary; in these cases, simply state so and concisely state why.*

### 2.2 Deployment Diagram

TODO Daniel

*This section should describe how the different components will be deployed on actual hardware devices. Similar to the previous subsection, this diagram may be unnecessary for simple systems; in these cases, simply state so and concisely state why.*

## 3 Low-Level Design

TODO Daniel

*Describe the low-level design for each of the system components identified in the previous section. For each component, you should provide details in the following UML diagrams to show its internal structure.*

### 3.1 Class Diagram

TODO Daniel

*In the case of an OO design, the internal structure of a software component would typically be expressed as a UML class diagram that represents the static class structure for the component and their relationships.*

### 3.2 Other Diagrams 

TODO Jason

*<u>Optionally</u>, you can decide to describe some dynamic aspects of your system using one or more behavioral diagrams, such as sequence and state diagrams.*

## 4 User Interface Design
TODO Daniel
*For GUI-based systems, this section should provide the specific format/layout of the user interface of the system (e.g., in the form of graphical mockups).*
